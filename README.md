### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is the final project at the alx ISWE program and of all the 9 projects to be chosen from, i chose to create the Personal Portfolio Website.

This process of this project improved my coding skill as a frontend developer.
  My journey in web development for the past 4 months at alx has been marked by dedication, continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence. I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, responsive design, JavaScript, and version control using Git and GitHub. These skills have empowered me to bring creative web concepts to life, and I can't wait to share some of my projects with you in future.
  In future, I will also love to comeback to this project to improve this project by:
  - Improving the html Code
  - Css Enhancement
  - Add animations
  - Add interactive features
  - Ensure the website is accessible
  - Visual designs e.t.c

### TECHNOLOGIES I USED
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language):  I used it to structure the content and creating the layout of my porfolio.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): I used to style and format my web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
- JavaScript:  I used it to add interactivity to my web page, such as form validation and handling the hamburger menu toggle functionality.
- EmailJS:  I used it to send email messages from my website's contact form.         This service is used to send email using JavaScript without setting up a server.
- FontAwesome: I used it include icons in your web pages, such as social media icons.

### CREDIT/ ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
 I will like to extend my gratitude to @alx_africa and the team as a whole for giving me the opportunity to take part in this program. I appreciate our technical mentors for taking time to explain projects to us during live sessions and at the same time made sure we are going through the right paths. Checking up on us  all the social media platforms especially discord to interact one and one with us. Everything I have learnt at the Intro to SWE program would have been nothing without alx. 
Thank you ALX
